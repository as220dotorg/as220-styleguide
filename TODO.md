# To Do

* Set better font stack for Montserrat
* Replace grid and layout template content with data and Twig loops
* Figure out how to get styleguide-specific to show up using the recommend file location. Right now it's hacked in. 

# Questions

* What should be excluded from Git? `npm-modules`? `public`?
