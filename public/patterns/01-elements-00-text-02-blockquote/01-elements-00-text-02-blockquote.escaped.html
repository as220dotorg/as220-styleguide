    &lt;p&gt;A block quotation (also known as a long quotation or extract) is a quotation in a written document, that is set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is typically distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface or smaller size quotation. It may or may not include a citation, usually placed at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
